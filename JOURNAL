Project: Landing Page from project odin Foundations course

This is a comebacklater after the comment below.  I also realize that by
changing the title to match the division I'm working it, I might also
give myself a clue when I screw something up.
------------

Still thinking about just how to go about structuring things.  Right now,
I'm conflicted.  The directory tree idea is just sort of the git build tree
stuff.  So I need to see just how the branching and merging works.  I can
save resources that way.  So I need to plan my commits and what I work on.

So if I commit before subdividing the carcass, then after, Then after each 
subdivision, making sure it works before I commit, I should be able to roll
back to a working version each time I break it in the future.

so -- plan to repair breakage and make it as easy as I can.  Oh, I should
probably clean out some old things or put in a directory in a .gitignore file.

I've been thinking about this project.  I think my analysis of how to
put it together are a bit off.

First -- I want to create a heirarchy of directories so that I've got
the equivalent of the html heirarchy in my directory tree.  For each subdivision, I make a subdirectory.  And that subdirectory will have one for each
subdivision within it.

A directory with no subdirectories is an html division with no subdivisions
within it. (Exceptions allowed -- for example a list of links...

Why go to all that trouble? 

Mostly as a method of self-discipline.  I have a grasshopper mind.  It jumps
from thought to thought and occasionally takes off in a colorful whirrr...
flying off into fascinating and colorful places.  The good part is this 
gives me an oversurfiet (grasshopper mind here: oversupply of overabundance?
is there a word like oxymoron(a word or phrase that contradicts itself -- jumbo shrimp) which means a word that is overly too much redundant? Bad writers write
haystack paragraphs.  I beat them with haystack sentences! Bad grasshopper
mind! Back to our previously interupted train of thought, waiting patiently,
the huge black engine venting a hwoosh of wet-smelling steam, then wending
back onto the track of the benifits to a grashopper mind.  I rarely run out
of ideas.

The biggest problem is retaining focus and direction.  If I approach it in
a systematic manner, I should be able to work as a one-man team.  I suspect
that branching and merging in git might have some use, too.  But I can hold
it together for smaller bits, then use them to build bigger ones, and Bob's
your uncle.  You decide whether he's your mother or father's brother.

My base directory will contain the page's index.html file.  Just for my
cognitive comfort, I'll make a hard link to the page's name... so for
this project, the root page, index.html, will also be available as Landing.html

After I have the html structure, and at least skeleton verbiage, then I can 
start building up the css decorations, starting from the simplest and working 
toward the more complex.

OK, I can start by using git.  I can delete an entire tree and get it back with\'git revert <treename>'  OK, dropping off to refactor all.

This is a learning project for me, so any suggestions or observations
are welcome.  Also, this will serve as notes on my progress, observations,
or just chatter.

It looks like the depository is setup right. I'll commit the changes to this
file, then push it to github.
