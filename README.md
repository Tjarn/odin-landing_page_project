# odin-landing_page_project

This repository is the first project in the Odin Project introductory
Foundation class.  It's also the first larger-to-me time that I'll be
trying to use git for revision control.

I'm in no hurry, so I'll be taking my time and taking notes in the JOURNAL 
that used to be this file but got renamed after it got too large.

This directory tree is my attempt at a clean decomposition of the page so
that I can learn how things interact.  It's nevertheless messy as I keep
revising how I want to organize things.

The first thing, after making a mess of things... I can't depend on
the <>body<>container to take care of overall sizing.  So first, since
I cant use 'body' for the actual body, I'll use 'carcass'

And from one of the .png files in RESOURCES directory, the carcass
is 1440 pixels wide by 1912 pixels high.
